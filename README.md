# pomodoro-libre

### Why? & The Purpose

The Pomodoro Method is one of the best techniques you can use for productivity, school, or work. To cut it brief, you set a timer for 25 minutes to do your work. After that is up, you take a 5 minute break. Rinse and repeat.

Look up "pomodoro", you will see a lot of options. BUT... they all require you to run JavaScript to use. This is infuriating, espically sense this is a simple timer.

The purpose of this project is to give people a lightweight, aesthetic, pomodoro timer. The program will be designed to run independently, so you can run it on your local machine and not have to open a web browser. The website is JavaScript-free, simple, and modern. The code will always be free under GNU GPL v2.0.

This project is underdevelopment, No website is up just yet :P
