### Why? & The Purpose

The Pomodoro Method is one of the best techniques you can use for productivity, school, or work. To cut it brief, you set a timer for 25 minutes to do your work. After that is up, you take a 5 minute break. Rinse and repeat.

If you look up pomodoro on your web browser, you will see a lot of options. BUT... they all require you to run JavaScript to use. Example being pomofocus.io. The website will not even run without Javascript. This is infuriating, espically sense it is something so minuscule.

The purpose of this project is to give people a lightweight, aesthetic, pomodoro timer. Either using Java program on your machine without going on the internet, or using a website (website not built yet).
