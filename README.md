# pomodoro-libre

### Why? & The Purpose

The Pomodoro Method is one of the best techniques you can use for productivity, school, or work. To cut it brief, you set a timer for 25 minutes to do your work. After that is up, you take a 5 minute break. Rinse and repeat.

Look up "pomodoro", you will see a lot of options. BUT... they all require you to run JavaScript to use. This is infuriating, espically sense it is something so minuscule. 

The purpose of this project is to give people a lightweight, aesthetic, pomodoro timer. The program will be designed to run independently, so you can run it on your local machine and not have to open a web browser. The website is JavaScript-free, simple, and modern. The code will always be free under GNU GPL v2.0.

This project is underdevelopment, No website is up just yet :P
